A Joomla! 2.x-3.x component based on the DHX (DHTMLX) Scheduler

This is a calendar component that uses the Scheduler product from DHX (http://http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler).

An added feature is event alerts (SMS/email) sent to configured alertees.

The component uses Sqlite3 databases for calendar information, allowing separate calendars for all users, groups, or site-wide.
